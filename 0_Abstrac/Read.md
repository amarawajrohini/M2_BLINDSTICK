                                         M2_BLINDSTICK
This Project is aimed to aid the blind people and enabling them to analyse and judge the environment by the use of the ultrasonic sensors. the blind man can easily detect and differentiate the things/obstacles from irregularities of the roads like pits and other things. If there’s an obstacle in front of the blind man the vibratory circuit gets activated and if there’s any irregularity in the road the buzzer gets activated. And the all these sensors and indicating element are controlled via an Arduino mega. In this project we are using one Arduino, Ultrasonic senor, buzzer ,vibration motor and switch.
