## REPORT
The presented system is disgned and configured for practical use. The system is able to hanble seven states that may face the blind people . the system will respond to each state. according to the specific program which is coded and installed in the arduino microcontroller. 
 when  obstacle is detected by the ultrasonic sensor in the left, right and front side of the stick, then arduino send the message to the blind  person through buzzer and vibrator and also send the voice message through earphone. The light sensor is used to detect presence or absence of light , of there  is no light 
then the buzzer will be On, warning through vibration and voice
message through earphone.

 water sensor is used to detect the presence of water and send the
message to the blind through buzzer, vibrator, and also send the voice message through earphone.

A simple, cheap, configurable, easy to handle electronic guidance system is proposed to provide constructive assistant and support for blind and visually impaired persons.
 
 The system is designed , implemented tested, and verified. The real-time
result of the system are encouraging; ot revealed an accuracy of 93% in detecting distances

 

 The results indicate that the system is efficient and unique in its capability in  specifying the source
and  distance of the objects that may encounter the blind. it is able to scan areas left, right.


 In front of the blind person regardless of its height or depth.
Therefore, it WaS favoured by those who Participated in the test. The ultrasonic sensor
has been fully Utilized in order to advance the mobility of the blind and visual
impaired people in safe and independent Way.

The water and light sensors are used for the detection of presence of
water and light. This system does not require a huge device to be hold for a long distance, and it also does not require any special training. This system also resolves limitations that
are related to the most of the movement problems that may influence the blind people in their environment. 


FUTURE WORK OF MY PROJECT is the system can be supplemented with GPS and GSM module by this we can provide safety and also it helps to track the blind person.
